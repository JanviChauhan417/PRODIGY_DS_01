1.   Power BI Project: Analysis of World Development Indicators
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of global development metrics sourced from the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset. The report primarily focuses on aggregating and comparing key socio-economic indicators across various country income groups and world regions.

2.   Short Description / Purpose – World Development Indicators
This Power BI report analyzes key global development metrics using the World Development Indicators dataset. It visualizes the distribution and comparison of indicators like population and economic figures across different income groups and world regions. The dashboard also highlights data completeness and source consistency, supporting insights into global disparities and development trends.

3    Tech Stack
list the key technologies used to build the dashboard.
Example:
the dashboard was built using the followin tools and technologies:
. power BI Desktop- main data visulization platform used for report creation.
. Excel- Data tranformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
. File Format-.pbip for development and .JPG for dashboard previews.

4   Data Source

Example:
Source:data.worldbank.org & World Development Indicators

5  Key Features & Use Cases: .   Bar Charts (Left Panel):
The top two charts display the sum of two key numerical indicators (likely related to economic output or population) broken down by development categories such as LIC (Low-Income Countries), MIC (Middle-Income Countries), HIC (High-Income Countries), and regional groups (e.g., EAS, LMC, ST).
These visualizations highlight disparities and contributions among income levels and world regions, with clear color-coded segmentation for better comparability.

.   Stacked Bar Chart (Right Panel):
Shows the count of data sources and their respective contributions to a selected development indicator (e.g., “Total Population”) across different dimensions.
This helps assess data completeness, identify gaps (e.g., blank or duplicate entries), and validate consistency in indicator reporting.

.   Facilitates data-driven policy evaluation and decision-making by highlighting population and economic distribution across development tiers.Useful for researchers, policy analysts, and international organizations monitoring global progress and disparities.Supports quality assurance through data source validation.
